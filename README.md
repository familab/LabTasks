# LabTasks
Laptop Room:

  - Toekicks - Toe Kick hardware is sitting on the floor in Biohacking room. Needs to be cut to size and attached to the legs of the cabinet

  - Throw out black microwave, replace it with old one from old lab.

  - Custom power Strips:

        --What I would like is something resembling our current power strips in size, but maybe the length of the table. In addition to power I would like to add USB (3A+), a lighting button (see lighting project) and a few cat 5/6 jacks. Most of the purchasable ones I have seen seem quite expensive and large. I was thinking we could get some aluminum or sheet metal bend it to about the same shape as the current ones, cut the needed holes ad start mounting shit in it. It would be important to get a quality USB, maybe tear apart and use something like http://amzn.com/B00Q88Q16K

  - Upholstered Benches

       --So my plan here was to remove the tops of the benches, attach a layer of egg crate foam (http://amzn.com/B0007PB85O or something like, but not something with "zones") and then a layer of memory foam (http://amzn.com/B003LVY4HA need to figure out what size to get) and then some white vinyl (http://amzn.com/B00FVE8WMS do they have familab blue? ) and staple the vinyl to the bottom of the tops.

  - Customized Lighting

       --Pendant lights from ikea ($10-$20 each), maybe 3 per set of tables. I want to put Phillips Hue bulbs (we have some already allocated for this) in them. The button on the power strip would turn the light on/off but from your phone/website you could control it to any temperature/color. We could also make full room scenes.
       
       -- With Gadgetcat permission, replace the led lights in the vending with rgbw + a xigbee so they are hue compatible so they can take part in the full room scenes.
        
      -- More of the same led strips in each of the existing overhead lights also hue compatible.

  - Restroom Signs
      -- I love the walk sign we have, but I want to make it smaller. I was thinking something thin, that normally would have white led's reading Restroom or some such. It would look like a sign you would see in a restaurant but lit. Then when the light was on in the restroom it switch to in use (red/orange). I believe the wiring is super simple except having to convert 2 sources of AC (line and switch) to dc.

  - Upgraded Wall
      -- The wall shared with the classroom I would like to be metallic (will this fuck up wifi?) and either a chalkboard or a whiteboard.

      -- If its metallic we can poster the hell out of it with refrigerator magnets.
I was thinking chalkboard cause I can buy a bucket of sidewalk chalk and not worry about it drying out or walking away (NOT a challenge). White board if the chalkboard idea doesn't work out.


  - K-cups and drawer organizer (or put these in the machine?)
  - Plastic Cups and Holder for the water cooler  (thanks chorca!)
  - Tea + Coffee Accessories (sugar packets, creamer, etc) with holders and tiny trash can
  - Sponge holder for the sink
  - Soap dispenser for the sink
  - Paper towel holder and paper towels for the sink




Classroom:
  - Display shelf

Biohacking Room:
  - Door Window: Plan, modify and purchase glass for Bio room door
  - Install final drawer (hardware sitting on labby table)

Warehouse:
  - Organization: Wood tools on HAAS/2.5D CNC side of warehouse, Metal tools in area near ramp door side of warehouse
  - Create path for HAAS between Bay door and HAAS resting spot, moving items out of the way (storage racks are the boundary) 

Bathrooms:
  - Bathroom Decor & Accessories
  - Soap dispensers (liquid soap or liquid soap foamers)
  - Toilet roll holders (non-mounted; 5 roll storage)
  - Wall mounted mirrors (I need this)
  - Trash cans


Misc:
  - Autoclose hinges on all doors except classroom doors
  - Replace 2 interior-grade doors to warehouse with exterior-grade doors
  - Touch up painting and patching

      -- Eggshell for Lobby room

      -- Semi-gloss for every other room

  - On Air Booth
      -- Some of us cowork, and it'd be cool to have a spot to sit when on a video call. This would also be good for people who prefer not to be shoulder surfed. Maybe could put this elsewhere. I know Da3v wants a Bill & Ted booth. :p
